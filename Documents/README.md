Dear Morgan,
 
You are approved for 3 credits internship summer 2023 for your work under Dr. Ricardo Alcalá-Briseño with the REEU funded by the USDA-NIFA designed to provide foundational biocomputational experience to undergraduates interested in working with Big Data to answer biological questions related to agriculture.
 
A departmental override is now in place for you to register for ENSC 410 under CRN 70414 for summer 2023.  Please note that this is a variable credit course, and you will need to adjust the credits from 1 to 3 upon registration. 
 
Upon registration, ENSC 410 will show up in your CANVAS as a summer course. I am the instructor of record, and Dr. Alcalá-Briseño is your supervisor. The class is graded P/N. To earn a “P” you will need to submit the following by Friday of Week 10 (September 1, 2023):
 
You through CANVAS:
